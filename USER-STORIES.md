# User Stories for Goodreads

This is a backlog of user stories for Goodreads, a platform for discovering, reviewing, and tracking books. These user stories are structured similarly to IntegriMark's backlog and represent common Goodreads features, though they may not reflect actual development priorities.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in Goodreads and available to users.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a reader, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so I can easily find books that interest me.  
2. As a user, I want to add books to my personal "Want to Read" list, so I can keep track of books I plan to read in the future.  
3. As a reviewer, I want to rate and review books I have read, so I can share my opinions and help others decide what to read.  

### Other Features

1. As a user, I want to create and organize custom bookshelves, so I can categorize my books according to my preferences.  
2. As a reader, I want to receive personalized book recommendations based on my reading history and ratings, so I can discover new books that align with my interests.  
3. As a social reader, I want to follow friends and see their book activity, so I can stay updated on what they are reading and recommending.  
4. As a user, I want to join and participate in reading groups, so I can discuss books with like-minded readers.  

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a user, I want to set reading goals for the year and track my progress, so I can stay motivated to read more books.  
2. As an audiobook listener, I want to track audiobooks separately from physical books, so I can differentiate my reading formats.  
3. As a reader, I want to receive notifications when an author I follow releases a new book, so I can stay informed about their latest works.  
4. As a user, I want to participate in book giveaways and enter contests, so I can win free books from publishers and authors.  
5. As a reader, I want to see reviews from professional critics alongside user reviews, so I can get a broader perspective on a book before reading it.  
6. As a user, I want to export my reading data, so I can keep an external backup of my reading history and reviews.  
7. As a group organizer, I want to schedule and manage virtual book club meetings within Goodreads, so I can facilitate discussions more effectively.  
8. As a user, I want to be able to mark books as "Did Not Finish" (DNF), so I can track books I started but chose not to complete.  
9. As an author, I want to engage with readers through Q&A sessions on my book pages, so I can interact with my audience and answer their questions.  
10. As a reader, I want to compare book prices across multiple retailers from within Goodreads, so I can find the best deal before purchasing.  
11. As a user, I want to receive a weekly digest of trending books and top reviews, so I can stay updated on the latest book discussions.  
12. As a social reader, I want to create and participate in book challenges, so I can engage with other users and motivate myself to read more.
