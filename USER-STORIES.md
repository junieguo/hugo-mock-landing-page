# User Stories for IntegriMark

This is a backlog of user stories for IntegriMark, [an actual tool for watermarking and encrypting educational materials](https://github.com/integrimark). These user stories are provided as a toy example, and do not coincide with actual features of IntegriMark, except for the **Current Features**, which are both actually implemented in the tool and highlighted in this landing page.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in IntegriMark, and which feature on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As an educator, I want to securely watermark PDF documents with unique, student-specific details, so I can trace the source of any leaked document back to the individual who shared it.
2. As a student, I want to receive a customized URL for accessing encrypted files, so I can securely download educational materials shared by my educators.
3. As an educator, I want to integrate IntegriMark with email systems for automated mailing of document links, streamlining the distribution process.

### Other Features

1. As a system administrator, I want to employ an invisible layer of randomly generated text over watermarked documents, preventing meaningful text from being copied and ensuring the document's integrity.
2. As an educator, I want to automate the encryption, hosting, and distribution of watermarked documents on platforms like GitHub Pages, ensuring a secure, cost-effective, and labor-efficient solution.
3. As a developer or contributor, I want to easily install IntegriMark using pip, ensuring a straightforward setup process for users.
4. As a user, I want to have a clear guide on how to use IntegriMark, including commands for creating encrypted bundles and generating URLs, so I can utilize the tool effectively. (_Note: We combined this user story with the previous one._)

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As an educator, I want to integrate IntegriMark with learning management systems (LMS) like Canvas or Moodle, so I can automate the distribution of watermarked documents within my existing teaching workflows.
2. As a student, I want to receive notifications when new materials are available for download, ensuring I don't miss out on important educational content.
3. As an educator, I want to view a dashboard of document access logs, so I can monitor which students have accessed the distributed materials and when.
4. As a system administrator, I want to implement IP tracking for document access, enabling an additional layer of security and traceability for shared documents.
5. As a user, I want to have the option to watermark and encrypt other types of documents, such as Word or PowerPoint files, expanding the tool's utility beyond PDFs.
6. As an educator, I want to set expiration dates for access to watermarked documents, ensuring materials cannot be accessed after a certain date.
